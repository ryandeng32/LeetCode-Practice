* Before doing anything, try to take care of error cases such as when arr is empty or absolute value is negative
* Think about the naive approach, and try to simplify the bottleneck
* **Technique** By inserting element in a **self-balancing BST**, it's sorted for fast search 
* **Technique**: Use **bucket** to achieve linear time complexity. This is also a great way to maintain a sliding window that's easy to search 
* **Buckets and BST** are great when we want to keep a sorted array whenever we insert something 

## Day5: 1305. All Element in Two Binary Search Trees
