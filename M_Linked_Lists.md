## 206. Reverse Linked List

* Think about how to do this both **iteratively** and **recursively**
* To think about the recursive solution, **assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, and then see how to reverse the front part**
* Understand the space complexity for using recusion. O(n) means **the recursion could go up to n levels deep**
