## 344. Reverse String 

**What's an in-place algorithm?** An algorithm which transforms input using **no auxiliary data structure** 

Note: Recursion doesn't use auxiliary DS, so we can use recursion to solve in-place problem. **In-place therefore does not necessarily mean constant space complexity.** 

Solved with **Two Pointers Approach** 

## 75. Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Problem)

Solution: 

- Use three pointers to track the rightmost boundary of zeros, the leftmost boundary of twos and the current element under the consideration
- It's a **generalization of the 2 pointers technique**
